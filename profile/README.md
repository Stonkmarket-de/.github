## Hi there 👋

### 🙋‍♀️ Into
Hi, my name is Karl and I run the Stonkmarket. I basically built an advanced tool to analyze certain trading opportunities. For every trade in every book about investment or trading it always says "If thiss happens, if that happens.. it will be good/bad/neutral for stock XYZ". My idea was to filter the **perfect** environment for certain option's trades and get an alarm when the market is as close to it as possible. That's **Stonkmarket** (and my blog).
